Supervised by [Prof. Volker Deringer](https://www.chem.ox.ac.uk/people/volker-deringer/), 
I work in the field of atomistic simulation, 
with a focus on applying machine learning methods for amorphous materials modelling.

      The Zintl-Klemm Concept in the Amorphous State: A Case Study of Na-P Battery Anodes

    <div class="paper-abstract">
      Leveraging an interatomic force field built on an equivariant message-passing neural network architecture (<a href="https://mace-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">MACE</a>), this work evaluated the applicability of the traditional Zintl–Klemm rules to the amorphous Na–P binary system, commonly formed in sodium-ion batteries with phosphorus anodes, and provided further structural, energetic, and electronic analyses.

      Local Invariance Model for Short-Range Order in Binary Thermoelectrics
    </span>
    <div class="paper-abstract">
      This work introduced a general modelling strategy for binary systems with occupational disorder, employing a local-invariance energy expression within the Monte Carlo algorithm to sample disordered configurations. The algorithm was applied to the potential thermoelectric material V<sub>1+δ</sub>Sb, which exhibits substantial correlated disorder arising from excess vanadium atoms and the coupled displacive disorder of neighbouring atoms.
