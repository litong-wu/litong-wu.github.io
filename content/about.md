title: About
---

I was born and raised in 遵义 (Zūnyì), 贵州 (Guìzhōu), cradled by misty mountains, grey skies, and long childhood nights. My teenage years brought me beneath the unbroken sunlight of Singapore, a place that shaped me in many ways.

In recent years, the tranquil city of Oxford has seen me dozing over books and notes, exploring particles that form matter; the matter that forms us, the universe, and beyond. At times I shuttled between fume hoods hands full of deadly chemicals; at others I traced curly arrows to glimpse the fate of a molecule; all in search of decoding the message hidden within each symbol of the periodic table.

I have now (temporarily, at least) settled into the field of machine-learning-driven atomistic simulation, a burgeoning field that bridges one black box to another. Every day, I sit before a glowing screen, with processors humming behind the scenes, working with sincere intention towards discoveries that might one day be transformative.
